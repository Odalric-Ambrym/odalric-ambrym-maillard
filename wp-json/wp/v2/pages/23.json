This paper studies equivalence structure in the reinforcement learning (RL) setup, where transition distributions are no longer assumed to be known. We present a notion of similarity between transition probabilities of various state-action pairs of an MDP, which naturally defines an equivalence structure in the state-action space. We present equivalence-aware confidence sets for the case where the learner knows the underlying structure in advance. These sets are provably smaller than their corresponding equivalence-oblivious counterparts. In the more challenging case of an unknown equivalence structure, we present an algorithm called ApproxEquivalence that seeks to find an (approximate) equivalence structure, and define confidence sets using the approximate equivalence. To illustrate the efficacy of the presented confidence sets, we present C-UCRL, as a natural modification of UCRL2 for RL in undiscounted MDPs.

We assume that both the change points and the distributions before and after the change are unknown. We consider the class of piecewise-constant mean processes with sub-Gaussian noise, and we target a detection strategy that is uniformly good on this class (this constrains the false alarm rate and detection delay). We introduce a novel tuning of the GLR test that takes here a simple form involving scan statistics, based on a novel sharp concentration inequality using an extension of the Laplace method for scan-statistics that holds doubly-uniformly in time. This also considerably simplifies the implementation of the test and analysis. We provide (perhaps surprisingly) the first fully non-asymptotic analysis of the detection delay of this test that matches the known existing asymptotic orders, with fully explicit numerical constants. Then, we extend this analysis to allow some changes that are not-detectable by any uniformly-good strategy (the number of observations before and after the change are too small for it to be detected by any such algorithm), and provide the first robust, finite-time analysis of the detection delay.<\/em>\u00bb<br \/>\n[Erratum: We noticed that the proof of Th.4 is actually incomplete.

The variance of the noise is not assumed to be known. In this context, we tackle the problem of tuning the regularization parameter adaptively at each time step, while maintaining tight confidence bounds estimates on the value of the mean function at each point. To this end, we first generalize existing results for finite-dimensional linear regression with fixed regularization and known variance to the kernel setup with a regularization parameter allowed to be a measurable function of past observations. Then, using appropriate self-normalized inequalities we build upper and lower bound estimates for the variance, leading to Bersntein-like concentration bounds. The later is used in order to define the adaptive regularization. The bounds resulting from our technique are valid uniformly over all observation points and all time steps, and are compared against the literature with numerical experiments. Finally, the potential of these tools is illustrated by an application to kernelized bandits, where we revisit the Kernel UCB and Kernel Thompson Sampling procedures, and show the benefits of the novel adaptive kernel tuning strategy.<\/em>\u00bb<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>Variance-Aware Regret Bounds for Undiscounted Reinforcement Learning in MDPs<\/strong>, M.

Furthermore, we provide a novel analysis of the KLUCRL algorithm establishing a high-probability regret bound scaling as \\tilde O(\\sqrt{S\\sum_{s,a}V^\\star_{s,a}T) for this algorithm for ergodic MDPs, where S denotes the number of states and where V^\\star_{s,a} is the variance of the bias function with respect to the next-state distribution following action a in state s.

We finally compare the leading terms of the two bounds in some benchmark MDPs indicating that the derived bound can provide an order of magnitude improvement in some cases.

As often in prediction with expert advice, designing an algorithm that achieves near-optimal regret guarantees is straightforward, using aggregation of experts. However, when the comparison class is sufficiently rich, for instance when the best expert and the set of experts itself change over time, such strategies require to maintain a prohibitive number of weights (typically exponential with the time horizon). By contrast, designing strategies that both achieve a near-optimal regret and maintain a reasonable number of weights is highly non-trivial. We consider three increasingly challenging objectives (simple regret, shifting regret and sparse shifting regret) that extend existing notions defined for a fixed expert ensemble; in each case, we design strategies that achieve tight regret bounds, adaptive to the parameters of the comparison class, while being computationally inexpensive. Moreover, our algorithms are anytime, agnostic to the number of incoming experts and completely parameter-free. Such remarkable results are made possible thanks to two simple but highly effective recipes: first the \u201cabstention trick\u201d that comes from the specialist framework and enables to handle the least challenging notions of regret, but is limited when addressing more sophisticated objectives. Second, the \u201cmuting trick\u201d that we introduce to give more flexibility.

Users are modeled as latent mixtures of C many representative user classes, where each class specifies a mean reward profile across actions. Both the user features (mixture distribution over classes) and the item features (mean reward vector per class) are unknown a priori. The user identity is the only contextual information available to the learner while interacting. This induces a low-rank structure on the matrix of expected rewards r_a,b from recommending item a to user b. The problem reduces to the well-known linear bandit when either user or item-side features are perfectly known. In the setting where each user, with its stochastically sampled taste profile, interacts only for a small number of sessions, we develop a bandit algorithm for the two-sided uncertainty. It combines the Robust Tensor Power Method of Anandkumar et al. (2014b) with the OFUL linear bandit algorithm of Abbasi-Yadkori et al. (2011).

The observations given to the learner are of the form (x, y) with y = f (x) + \u03be, where x can have arbitrary dependency on the past observations, f is unknown and the noise \u03be is sub-Gaussian conditionally on the past observations. Further, the observations are assumed to come from some external filtering process making the number of observations itself a random stopping time. In this challenging scenario that captures a large class of processes with non-anticipative dependencies, we study the ordinary, ridge, and kernel least-squares estimates and provide confidence intervals based on self-normalized vector-valued martingale techniques, applied to the estimation of the mean and of the variance. We then discuss how these adaptive confidence intervals can be used in order to detect a possible model mismatch as well as to estimate the future (self-information, quadratic, or transportation) loss of the learner at a next step.\u00bb<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/researchers.lille.inria.fr\/~valko\/hp\/publications\/erraqabi2016pliable.pdf\">Pliable rejection sampling<\/a><\/strong>, A.

A large class of these new MCMC methods is based on randomly subsampling the dataset at each MCMC iteration. We investigate whether random projections can replace this random subsampling for linear regression of big streaming data. In the latter setting, random projections have indeed become standard for non-Bayesian treatments. We isolate two issues for MCMC to apply to streaming regression: 1) a resampling issue; MCMC should access the same random projections across iterations to avoid keeping the whole dataset in memory and 2) a budget issue; making individual MCMC acceptance decisions should require o(n) random projections. While the resampling issue can be satisfyingly tackled, current techniques in random projections and MCMC for tall data do not solve the budget issue, and may well end up showing it is not possible.<\/span>\u00bb<\/em><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center\">2014<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong><a title=\"\u201cHow hard is my MDP?\u201d Distribution-norm to the rescue.\" href=\"http:\/\/odalricambrymmaillard.wordpress.com\/2014\/12\/09\/how-hard-is-my-mdp-distribution-norm-to-the-rescue\/\">[Full oral] \u201cHow hard is my MDP?\u201d Distribution-norm to the rescue<\/a>, <\/strong>O.-A.

The loss on each cell consists of one term measuring a simple worst case quadratic sampling error, and a penalty term proportional to the range of the variance in that cell. The corresponding problem formulation extends the setting known as active learning for multi-armed bandits to the case when each arm is a continuous region, and we show how an adaptation of recent algorithms for that problem and of hierarchical optimistic sampling algorithms for optimization can be used in order to solve this problem.

At each policy iteration step, an approximation of the value function for the current policy is obtained by minimizing an empirical Bellman residual dened on a set of n states drawn i.i.d. from a distribution \\mu, the immediate rewards, and the next states sampled from the model. Our main result is a generalization bound for the Bellman residual in linear approximation spaces. In particular, we prove that the empirical Bellman residual approaches the true (quadratic) Bellman residual in \\mu-norm with a rate of order O(1\/\\sqrt{n}). This result implies that minimizing the empirical residual is indeed a sound approach for the minimization of the true Bellman residual which guarantees a good approximation of the value function for each policy. Finally, we derive performance bounds for the resulting approximate policy iteration algorithm in terms of the number of samples n and a measure of how well the function space is able to approximate the sequence of value functions.<\/span>\u00bb<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><!--more--><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><a href=\"http:\/\/odalricambrymmaillard.wordpress.com\/2014\/08\/03\/scrambled-objects-for-least-squares-regression\/\"><strong>Scrambled objects for least-squares regression<\/strong><\/a>, O.-A.

G_P is defined as the span of P random features that are linear combinations of the basis functions of F weighted by random Gaussian i.i.d. coefficients. In particular, we consider multi-resolution random combinations at all scales of a given mother function, such as a hat function or a wavelet. In this latter case, the resulting Gaussian objects are called scrambled wavelets and we show that they enable to approximate functions in Sobolev spaces H_s([0, 1]^d). As a result, given N data, the least-squares estimate \\hat g built from P scrambled wavelets has excess risk ||f^* \u2212 \\hat g||2 P = O(||f^*||2_{H_s([0,1]^d)}(logN)\/P + P(logN)\/N) for target functions f^* \\in H_s([0, 1]^d) of smoothness order s &gt; d\/2. An interesting aspect of the resulting bounds is that they do not depend on the distribution P from which the data are generated, which is important in a statistical regression setting considered here. Randomization enables to adapt to any possible distribution. We conclude by describing an efficient numerical implementation using lazy expansions with numerical complexity \\tilde O (2dN^3\/2 logN + N^2), where d is the dimension of the input space.<\/span>\u00bb<\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><a href=\"http:\/\/odalricambrymmaillard.wordpress.com\/2014\/08\/03\/lstd-with-random-projections\/\"><strong>LSTD with random projections<\/strong><\/a>, M.

We show that solving the problem in the compressed domain instead of the initial domain reduces the estimation error at the price of an increased (but controlled) approximation error.

An algorithm based on co-regularization methods with extra penalty terms reflecting smoothness and general agreement properties is proposed. We first provide explicit tight control on the Rademacher (L1 ) complexity of the corresponding class of learners for arbitrary many views, then give the asymptotic behavior of the bounds when the co-regularization term increases, making explicit the relation between consistency of the views and reduction of the search space. Third we provide an illustration through simulations on toy examples. With many views, a parameter selection procedure is based on the stability approach with clustering and localization arguments.
